Along with TikTok, the researchers also compiled instances of violent threats and calls for impeachment against judges on President Donald Trump&#x2019;s Truth Social platform, the anonymous message board 4chan, in the comments of video posts on the video-sharing site Rumble, and on Gab, a far-right social network.</p><p class="paywall">This uptick in posts comes as Trump, <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/elon-musk/">Elon Musk,</a> and other major figures on the right have shared <a class="external-link" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-administrations-conflict-judges-constitutional-crisis/story?id=119981540">inflammatory rhetoric</a> about the judiciary, especially in cases where judges have ruled against the current administration. In a Truth Social post in March, Trump called <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/18/g-s1-54493/judge-boasberg-trump-deportation-flights">Boasberg</a> a &#x201C;radical left lunatic&#x201D; who &#x201C;should be IMPEACHED!!!&#x201D; Musk called the court decisions impeding his so-called Department of Government Efficiency a &#x201C;judicial coup,&#x201D; <a class="external-link" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1902363014340165743">adding in a post on X</a>: &#x201C;impeach the judges.&#x201D;</p><p class="paywall">White House chief of staff <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cj0949qnlz2o">Stephen Miller</a> and <a class="external-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/pam-bondi-warns-deranged-judges-214148425.html">US attorney general Pam Bondi</a> have expressed similar views in recent months.

Judge John Coughenour was subjected to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigations/these-judges-ruled-against-trump-then-their-families-came-under-attack-2025-05-02/">a bomb threat</a> and a <a class="external-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/us/trump-judges-threats.html">swatting attack</a> in January after ruling against the Trump administration. Boasberg&#x2019;s brother, a former school superintendent, was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigations/these-judges-ruled-against-trump-then-their-families-came-under-attack-2025-05-02/">given a security detail</a> in March after far-right activist Laura Loomer made baseless allegations against him.</p><p class="paywall">&#x201C;There&#x2019;s no question that we&#x2019;re seeing a normalization of bigoted, violent, and other harmful speech on mainstream platforms,&#x201D; Wendy Via, the CEO and president of GPAHE tells WIRED. &#x201C;Trump and other extreme influencers&#x2019; threatening and mean-spirited posts and public comments has moved the once unthinkable to commonplace, online, in our communities, and in our political discourse, without thought to the very real dangers of regularly demonizing those that oppose you.&#x201D;</p></div></div></div></div><div class="GridWrapper-cAzTTK sjrqk grid grid-margins grid-items-2 ArticlePageChunksGrid-hfxaau eSqXkM grid-layout--adrail narrow wide-adrail"><div class="GridItem-buujkM stRKV grid--item grid-layout__content"><div class="BodyWrapper-kufPGa jVPeUt body body__container article__body"><div class="body__inner-container"><p class="paywall">The researchers found that the social platforms they examined all saw a significant spike in threatening posts in March.</p><p class="paywall">&quot;This report relies on anecdotal observations and exaggerated data to distort the reality of our platform,&#x201D; TikTok spokesperson Ben Rathe tells WIRED. &#x201C;Nevertheless, we continue to enforce our policies which strictly prohibit violent threats.&#x201D;</p><p class="paywall">In May last year, the researchers found just 35 threatening posts about US judges on TikTok. In March this year, they say that number had risen to 223 instances, marking a 537 percent increase.</p><p class="paywall">&#x201C;Given the large user base of TikTok, it&#x2019;s likely that it was only a matter of time before some content creators started to carve out a niche for users that sought the sort of threats we see today,&#x201D; says Luke Baumgartner, a research fellow at George Washington University&#x2019;s Program on Extremism. &#x201C;I think it&#x2019;s broadly a reflection of how some of those that occupy the highest political positions in the country are comfortable with openly threatening judges, giving ordinary social media users a chance to pass on the message.&#x201D;</p><p class="paywall">On Truth Social, where threats against judges were already commonplace, the number of posts, according to GPAHE, rose from 2,232 in May 2024 to 9,462 in March 2025, with an increase of 324 percent. Many of these posts were written directly in response to Trump&#x2019;s own threats against judges.</p><p class="paywall">The largest increase in threatening posts was recorded on Gab, a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gab-ai-chatbot-racist-holocaust/">platform favored by white supremacists and antisemites</a>, with threatening posts rising from 273 in May 2024 to 3,210 in March 2025, a 1,076 percent increase. 4chan and Rumble also saw significant increases in posts.</p><p class="paywall">&#x201C;All of a sudden you people are against calling for the impeachment of government officials or calling for them to be tried and convicted for treason? That&apos;s funny,&#x201D; Andrew Torba, the Christian nationalist who runs Gab, tells WIRED. Torba did not respond when asked specifically about the violent threats posted on his platform.</p><p class="paywall">Truth Social, 4chan, and Rumble did not respond to WIRED&#x2019;s request for comment.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div>
