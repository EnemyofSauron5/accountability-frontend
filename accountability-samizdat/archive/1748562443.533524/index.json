                    "Washington, DC (WorkersCompensation.com) \u2013 Amid lawsuits and firings, labor unions and others are raising questions and concerns over Elon Musk\u2019s, and his Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s (DOGE), access to the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) files and databases.\n\n\n\nEarlier this month a coalition of unions, the AFL-CIO, an economic think tank and other organizations filed suit against DOGE to limit access to the confidential worker information in the DOL\u2019s databases. Arguing DOGE is not an official government office because it was not created by Congress, the group said Musk and DOGE\u2019s actions were an illegal break of citizen\u2019s confidentiality and privacy.\n\n\n\nOn Feb. 7, a federal judge ruled that the unions and others lacked standing.\n\n\n\n\u201c(An) organization must point to a particular member and establish she would have standing if she were a plaintiff herself,\u201d Bates wrote. \u201cWhen seeking preliminary relief, this requires a submission on the record showing at least one particular member is substantially likely to suffer an injury at the hands of the defendant. \u2026 It\u2019s not enough that three of plaintiffs\u2019 general counsels submitted declarations that plaintiffs\u2019 members will be harmed.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut Bates did state that he has concerns about DOGE and Musk\u2019s alleged conduct. He also told the government\u2019s attorneys that they were asking him to have \u201ca great deal of confidence in people who, according to public reports, are very young, who have never been in the federal government, who have never had any training with respect to the hands of confidential information\u2026 (You) are asking me to just put absolute confidence in the fact that nothing will happen.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe coalition said OSHA is among the agencies DOGE is targeting for access. OSHA\u2019s database includes whistleblower information. Others, like the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Wage and Hour Division and the Federal Employees Compensation Act Claims Administration also hold sensitive worker information, they said.\n\n\n\nAFL-CIO President Liz Schuler said the unions will press forward.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe AFL-CIO, our affiliated unions, partners and allies will provide further evidence of standing and renew our efforts to block DOGE from accessing sensitive data at DOL and through our government, continuing the fight for transparency, accountability and the protection of the fundamental rights generations of workers fought to enact,\u201d she said in a press release.\n\n\n\nThere is also concern over what the DOGE purge of government employees and inspectors general will mean for the many investigations into Musk\u2019s companies.\n\n\n\nOn Jan. 24, President Donald Trump fired about 17 independent inspectors general across government agencies. The firings started that night and were effective immediately. The move effectively removes oversight from Trump\u2019s administration without warning. By law, the White House is supposed to give Congress 30 days-notice if it intends to fire an inspector general, along with the reasons why the inspectors were fired.\n\n\n\nTrump told reporters on Air Force One on Jan. 25, that the firings were a very common thing to do and that he would be replacing the inspectors with \u201cgood people in there that will be very good.\u201d\n\n\n\nCritics wonder what that will mean for Musk\u2019s companies, many of which are being investigated at the federal level.\n\n\n\nDuring a hearing of the hearing of the newly formed House Subcommittee on Delivering on Government Efficiency (also known as DOGE), U.S. Rep Greg Casar (D-Texas) said the Inspector General of the Department of Labor had 17 open investigations into Tesla and SpaceX. Additionally, he said, the U.S. Department of Transportation inspector general was investigating Tesla, the U.S. Department of Defense\u2019s inspector general was looking into SpaceX and the U.S. Department of Agriculture was investigating Neuralink (Musk\u2019s experimental company looking into computer brain implants), and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s inspector general was looking into Tesla for environmental violations.\n\n\n\nMusk\u2019s companies currently have an estimated $3 billion in contracts with the U.S. government, Casar said, meaning Musk will receive an average of $8 million a day.\n\n\n\nThe animosity between Musk and the federal government seems to go both ways. In recent years, SpaceX has sued the National Labor Relations Board claiming the agency is unconstitutional after the NLRB issued a complaint against the company for firing eight employees who criticized Musk in an open letter.\n\n\n\nThe DOL\u2019s OSHA has repeatedly fined Musk\u2019s companies for serious safety violations including an incident at SpaceX where a worker fell to his death from a truck whose cargo has not been secured. Another complaint was filed against the company when an employee was injured during a rocket test. OSHA has also fined Tesla for exposing workers to hazardous chemicals, and for multiple violations at another of Musk\u2019s companies, the Boring Company,\u00a0involving chemical burns and other worker injuries.\n\n\n\nDavid Michaels, a professor at the George Washington University\u2019s School of Public Health said there were concerns about what information the DOGE employees would have access to. Michaels, who was head of OSHA under President Barack Obama said in addition to the conflict of interest giving Musk access to the files presents, those files contain confidential information provided by workers across the country. Opening access to the files could discourage workers from filing future complaints, either about Musk\u2019s companies, or other companies.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, the coalition of unions amended their lawsuit to protect the information at the DOL, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The lawsuit expands the initial challenge to DOGE\u2019s attempt to access information. The labor groups said they would continue to fight DOGE\u2019s efforts.\n\n\n\n\u201cElon Musk and DOGE continue to jeopardize Americans\u2019 most sensitive, personal data, and threaten our health, safety, rights, paychecks, and the essential services we depend on,\u201d the AFL-CIO\u2019s Shuler said in a statement. \u201cUnions and allies will vigorously fight DOGE\u2019s attempt to put working people at risk through reckless actions that endanger workers and our families. They must be stopped\u2014and today we\u2019re getting back in court to do just that.\u201d"
