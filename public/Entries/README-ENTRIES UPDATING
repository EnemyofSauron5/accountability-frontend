# 1. Make sure you're in your project folder
cd path/to/your/project-folder

# 2. Check status to see what's been changed
git status

# 3. Add your changes (e.g., index.json)
git add index.json
# or if you want to add *all* changes:
# git add .

# 4. Commit your changes with a clear message
git commit -m "Update corruption timeline entries"

# 5. Push to GitHub
git push origin main
Note I have written a script that does this automatically in the root directory, but if you ever want to do it manually, this is the way to go!
