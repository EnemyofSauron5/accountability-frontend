Regional Commissioner Linda Kerr-Davis acknowledged that 'things are going to break, and they're going to break fast,' noting the cuts could limit the agency's ability to combat fraud, waste, and abuse. Additionally, the SSA is shifting its communications approach, with regional offices no longer issuing press releases or 'dear colleague' letters to advocate groups. Instead, the agency announced it would primarily use Elon Musk's X platform to communicate with the media and public. As of mid-April 2025, the official SSA X account had only 138,000 followers, representing less than one percent of the approximately 70 million Americans who receive Social Security benefits. After the initial reports, both the White House and the SSA posted denials on X claiming the reporting was false, with the SSA stating it 'will continue to communicate through any and all mediums.' However, observers noted that no press releases had been published on the SSA website since March 27, 2025.",

Greene bought shares in companies that had been hit hard by the tariff announcement, including Apple, FedEx, Amazon, Nike, Tesla, and Nvidia, which had seen their values drop by as much as 40%. On April 9, hours before announcing the tariff pause, Trump posted on Truth Social: 'THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!' The S&P 500 jumped 9.5% and the Nasdaq rose 12.2% following the announcement. When questioned about the timing, Greene stated she has 'signed a fiduciary agreement to allow my financial advisor to control my investments.' Democratic lawmakers, including Rep. Gregorio Casar, called for investigations into potential insider trading.",

    "summary": "President Trump confirmed that 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada would take effect, causing financial markets to reel with a selloff in global stocks and falling bond yields. The Mexican peso and Canadian dollar both fell following his remarks. This followed an earlier pattern where Trump had imposed tariffs on these countries on February 1, 2025, citing concerns about illegal immigration and fentanyl flows, then paused them for 30 days on February 3 after negotiations, only to reinstate them in March. The back-and-forth nature of these tariff policies created significant market volatility, with the S&P 500 losing $4 trillion in value from its peak. One analyst described how Trump's policies had turned the U.S. economy 'from the envy of the world to a laughingstock in less time than it took to finish March Madness.'",

The memorandum claims that notice-and-comment proceedings are 'unnecessary' when repeal is required as a matter of law, though legal experts dispute this broad application of an exception intended primarily for emergency situations.

The Social Security Administration placed these individuals in the Death Master File at the request of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who signed memorandums of agreement with acting Social Security commissioner Leland Dudek earlier this month. This tactic is designed to pressure immigrants to leave the country by effectively cutting them off from financial systems that rely on Social Security verification. Records obtained by The Washington Post show the falsely deceased include children as young as 13, elderly people in their 70s and 80s, and a Haitian asylum seeker. The White House claims these immigrants all have ties to terrorist activity or criminal records, though specific evidence of these allegations has not been provided.

    "summary": "Former President Donald Trump has earned at least $300,000 in royalties from selling 'God Bless the USA' Bibles for $59.99-$90 each, according to financial disclosures. The Bibles, which contain the King James Version along with American founding documents and a handwritten chorus from Lee Greenwood's song, were produced in China for less than $3 per unit. Trade records indicate approximately 120,000 Bibles were shipped to the US with potential revenue of about $7 million. Critics have questioned the quality of the Bibles and noted the irony of production in China given Trump's anti-China trade rhetoric. The Bibles are sold through a licensing arrangement with Trump's company CIC Ventures LLC, with Trump receiving a portion of sales. The product launch in March 2024 coincided with Trump facing significant legal bills and financial pressures.",

Additionally, the IRS has agreed to share confidential tax records with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to help deport an estimated 7 million undocumented immigrants, despite longstanding privacy protections. Critics warn these practices threaten privacy, evoke historical abuses of government data collection, and may discourage tax payments from undocumented immigrants who contributed an estimated $96.7 billion in taxes in 2022.",

The order allows for the firing of civil servants for 'subversion of Presidential directives' and has been challenged by multiple lawsuits, including one from the National Treasury Employees Union arguing it violates Congressional intent. While acknowledging legitimate concerns about accountability in federal employment, the article argues this approach prioritizes personal loyalty over Constitutional obligations and would make government less effective.",
