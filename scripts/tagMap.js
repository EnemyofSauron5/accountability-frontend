// 
// Tag consolidation mappings for the Accountability Archive
// 
// This file defines how tags are consolidated during the rewrite process.
// Each key represents an original tag, and its value is the consolidated tag
// it should be mapped to. A value of `null` means the tag is retired entirely.
//
// For historical context and rationale behind consolidation decisions,
// see CONSOLIDATION_LOG.md in this directory.
//
// Usage: node scripts/rewriteTags.js
//
