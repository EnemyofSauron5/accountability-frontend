This followed an earlier pattern where Trump had imposed tariffs on these countries on February 1, 2025, citing concerns about illegal immigration and fentanyl flows, then paused them for 30 days on February 3 after negotiations, only to reinstate them in March. The back-and-forth nature of these tariff policies created significant market volatility, with the S&P 500 losing $4 trillion in value from its peak. One analyst described how Trump's policies had turned the U.S. economy 'from the envy of the world to a laughingstock in less time than it took to finish March Madness.'",

At the Social Security Administration, DOGE is pushing for a rapid rewrite of decades-old COBOL code in a matter of months, despite expert warnings that such a hasty transition risks system collapse and disruption of benefits. DOGE operatives have reportedly proposed involving Palantir in creating a 'mega API' at the IRS to facilitate easier data access. The Government Accountability Office has launched an audit examining DOGE's handling of data at several federal agencies. Court filings show DOGE attempting to transfer the headquarters of the independent United States Institute of Peace to the government at no cost, and working to infiltrate Treasury payment systems in ways that could be used against USAID. Labor leaders have expressed concerns that DOGE could gain access to OSHA whistleblower files, potentially compromising worker safety protections at Musk-owned companies that have dozens of open workplace safety cases.",

This approach allows agencies to make significant regulatory changes without public input or formal review processes typically required by law. The memorandum claims that notice-and-comment proceedings are 'unnecessary' when repeal is required as a matter of law, though legal experts dispute this broad application of an exception intended primarily for emergency situations. By directing agencies to categorically use this exception, the administration potentially circumvents important administrative safeguards designed to prevent arbitrary regulatory actions and ensure public participation in the rulemaking process.",

The falsifications occurred despite senior Social Security staff warning the move was illegal because it violates privacy laws and involves purposeful falsification of government records. The request to label immigrants dead came directly from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who signed memorandums of agreement with acting Social Security commissioner Leland Dudek authorizing the placements in Social Security's Death Master File. Being falsely listed as dead has potentially dire consequences as the database is shared with other government agencies, employers, banks, and landlords, effectively cutting off affected individuals from financial systems and housing opportunities. Records show the falsely deceased include children as young as 13, elderly people in their 70s and 80s, and a Haitian asylum seeker, contradicting White House claims that the targets all have ties to terrorist activity or criminal records.",

Financial disclosure records show Trump's bond investments far exceeded his stock market exposure (excluding his Trump Media holdings), with bonds accounting for about 60 percent of his portfolio at the low end of disclosure ranges. While there is no direct evidence that Trump's personal finances motivated his decision, the reversal came specifically after the government bond market had started to collapse, sending the value of government debt sharply lower. This raises significant questions about conflicts of interest stemming from Trump's decision not to place his assets in a blind trust where he would not be able to control them. After announcing the tariff pause, Trump celebrated the market's positive reaction, stating, 'The bond market right now is beautiful.'",

Legal scholars criticized the rationale as legally incoherent. The decision follows President Trump’s removal of OSC chief Hampton Dellinger, who had launched investigations before being replaced by Jamieson Greer.
